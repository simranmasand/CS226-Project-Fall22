# CM 226: Project proposal (Fall 2022)
##    \item Title
    \item Team members
    \item Define the problem.
    \item What prior approaches have been proposed (related work)?     
    \item What is your approach  ?    
    \item How will you evaluate your approach and compare to prior work ?  
    \item Is code available for competing methods ?     
    \item What dataset(s) will you use  ? Are the datasets formatted and easy to use or do you need to process data ?  
\end{itemize}

## Project Prompt:
Predict disease risk from genome
sequence data
Given genome sequence (or genotype data)
and disease status, learn a predictor that is
accurate on new individual.
See Dataset 6 in google doc

Predict disease risk from genome
sequence data
Given genome sequence (or genotype data)
and disease status, learn a predictor that is
accurate on new individual.
Variations: What if the individual is from a
different population than the training data ?
What if individual data is not available but
summary data is available ?

% %%%%
% This writeup must describe the problem, related work, and the proposed research (e.g. we plan to apply method X on data Z, we plan to modify method W). For the proposed research, you should think about data  you will use to evaluate your proposed method to prior methods (if simulated data, say how you plan to simulate. for real datasets, do you have access to the data? if you are comparing to a previous method, is the software/results available for you to compare ? ) and the metrics you will use in the comparison.
