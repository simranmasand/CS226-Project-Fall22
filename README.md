    \item Define the problem.
    \item What prior approaches have been proposed (related work)?     
    \item What is your approach  ?    
    \item How will you evaluate your approach and compare to prior work ?  
    \item Is code available for competing methods ?

% %%%%
% This writeup must describe the problem, related work, and the proposed research (e.g. we plan to apply method X on data Z, we plan to modify method W). For the proposed research, you should think about data  you will use to evaluate your proposed method to prior methods (if simulated data, say how you plan to simulate. for real datasets, do you have access to the data? if you are comparing to a previous method, is the software/results available for you to compare ? ) and the metrics you will use in the comparison.
